## What You Can Observe

### Request-Level Metrics

- **Latency**: Time to first token, total request duration
- **Costs**: Token usage and dollar costs per request
- **Model Performance**: Completion quality, error rates
- **Request/Response Data**: Full input prompts and completions
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, model versions, provider info

### Aggregate Metrics

- **Total Costs**: Track spending across all requests
- **Usage Patterns**: Requests per day, peak usage times
- **Error Rates**: Failed requests, rate limits, timeouts
- **User Analytics**: Cost and usage per user
- **Session Analytics**: Multi-turn conversation metrics
